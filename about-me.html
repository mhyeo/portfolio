      <h3>Education</h3>
      <p>I'm currently a Junior at Carnegie Mellon Univeristy studying
        <em>Information Systems and Computer Science!</em> I'm hoping to become
        a software engineer and maybe later a teacher.</p>

      <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
      <p>I grew up playing chess and tennis, but I love to play volleyball and
        golf too! I'm always looking for more ways to be active. Although I
        don't play competetively, I'm a huge fan of <em>Super Smash Brothers Melee</em>
        and pretty much any video game.</p>
